# Typos for *Mastering Node.js Web Development*

This file contains smaller errors that are unlikely to prevent the code examples from working and which I will correct in the next edition of the book. See [this](errata.md) file for mistakes that prevent the code examples from working as expected.

**Chapter 3**

On page 30, this sentence:

>The tsc-watc1h package does the same thing for TypeScript files, and the typescript package
contains the TypeScript compiler. 

should be:

>The **tsc-watch** package does the same thing for TypeScript files, and the typescript package
contains the TypeScript compiler. 

(Thanks to Cesar Rodriguez Olvera for reporting this problem)
