# Errata for *Mastering Node.js Web Development*

This file contains errors that are likely to prevent the code examples from working as described in ths book. See [this](typos.md) file for small mistakes that I intend to correct in the next edition.

**Chapter 2**

On page 10, the instructions for installing Node.js initially specify version 20.9.0 but then switch to version 20.10.0. The examples have been tested with both versions, but you should use 20.10.0 for preference.

(Thanks to Richard Bradley for reporting this problem)
